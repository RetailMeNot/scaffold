# Contributing
The development of Scaffold is intended to be a community driven effort; because of this, all contributions from the community are important! Regardless of a bug or a major feature addition/change, please file an issue for it. Ticket tracking allows everyone to ensure we're not duplicating efforts and obtaining the highest quality of work prior to merging.

## Code of Conduct
Be sure to view our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kgress/scaffold/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Check Configuration
If you're having troubles with DesiredCapabilities or see Spring application context issues, it's more than likely a misconfiguration. Check out the project [README](https://github.com/kgress/scaffold/README.md) with steps on creating the configurations. If you're confident that the configuration is not a problem and you've narrowed it down to a bug in the framework, please follow the bug filing procedure detailed in this document.

## Filing Bugs
* First ensure the bug has not been filed yet under our Issues.
* If the issue does not exist, open a new issue with a clear and concise title. Please include a detailed description of the problem along with any accompanying code and reproduction steps.

When writing the description of the issue for a new bug, please follow the template/example below.

### Bug Template 
<title of ticket> WebDriver fails to instantiate due to NPE in TestContext </title of ticket>

h1. Bug:
This WebDriverManager isn't working because of a NPE in the TestContext! The NPE is caused by WebDriverContext not wiring in DesiredCapabilities. See code blurb below.

Code blurb:
```
A fancy code example where the bug is happening

h1. Expected:
We shouldn't be seeing any NPE's from the instantiation of the WebDriver and the DesiredCapabilities should be wiring in correctly.

## New Feature / Feature Improvement Proposals
Do you have a brand new feature idea? Do you think an existing feature could be updated? File an issue for it! Having a formal issue filed will allow for further discussion from other contributors. There is almost always the potential for risks or other considerations that our peers may see. Use this to your advantage! 

* First ensure your feature idea or improvement has not been filed yet under our Issues.
* If the issue does not exist, open a new issue with a clear and concise title. Please include a detailed description of why you think the new feature should be added and how this would be implemented along with relevant Acceptance Criteria. If it's an update to an existing feature, be sure to include the shortcomings of the existing feature and why the update is necessary.
